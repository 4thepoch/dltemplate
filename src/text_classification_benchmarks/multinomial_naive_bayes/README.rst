Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
----------------------------------

Naive Bayes is a family of algorithms based on applying Bayes theorem with a naive assumption,
that every feature is independent of the others, in order to predict the category of a given
sample. They are probabilistic classifiers, therefore will calculate the probability of each
category using Bayes theorem, and the category with the highest probability will be output.

We do have other options for classification tasks, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and
neural networks. However, the simple design of Naive Bayes classifiers make them very attractive
for such classifiers. Moreover, they have been demonstrated to be fast, reliable and accurate
in a number of applications of NLP.

Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is a specific instance of a Naive Bayes classifier which uses
a multinomial distribution for each of the features.

Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are often used as baselines for other
methods in text categorization and sentiment analysis research. However, their performance varies
significantly depending on which variant, features and datasets are used.

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is better at snippets.
