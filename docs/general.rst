What do you do with...
----------------------

1. Reinforcement Learning. Acting in a dynamic environment by trying to optimize a deferred reward.
      * A/B Testing - Bandit algorithm as an alternative to randomized controlled trials.
      * Drug Discovery
2. General Adversarial Networks (GAN).
      * We have difficulty defining a reward function, but have examples of what good looks like.
